# Arcturus for iOS 10
Enables the Night Shift button for the Control Center on iOS 10 for h3lix-compatible devices.

DOES NOT ENABLE THE NIGHT SHIFT OPTION IN SETTINGS->DISPLAY AND BRIGHTNESS, **NOR DOES IT WORK**. IT'S FOR **LOOKS ONLY**.

Functionality is being worked on, and will be published for public use soon.
